under sub-section (3) or any earlier previous year (being a previous year not earlier than the year in
which the ship or aircraft was acquired or the machinery or plant was installed or the ship, aircraft,
machinery or plant was first put to use) and credited to a reserve account (to be called the &quot;Investment
Allowance Reserve Account&quot;) to be utilised—
  (a) for the purposes of acquiring, before the expiry of a period of ten years next following the
previous year in which the ship or aircraft was acquired or the machinery or plant was installed,
a new ship or a new aircraft or new machinery or plant [other than machinery or plant of the
nature referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (d) of the second proviso to sub-section (1)] for the
purposes of the business of the undertaking; and
  (b) until the acquisition of a new ship or a new aircraft or new machinery or plant as aforesaid, for
the purposes of the business of the undertaking other than for distribution by way of dividends
or profits or for remittance outside India as profits or for the creation of any asset outside India:
Provided that this clause shall have effect in respect of a ship as if for the word &quot;seventy-five&quot;, the
word &quot;fifty&quot; had been substituted.
Explanation.—Where the amount debited to the profit and loss account and credited to the Investment
Allowance Reserve Account under this sub-section is not less than the amount required to be so credited on
the basis of the amount of deduction in respect of investment allowance claimed in the return made by the
assessee under section 139, but a higher deduction in respect of the investment allowance is admissible on
the basis of the total income as proposed to be computed by the Assessing Officer under section 143, the
Assessing Officer shall, by notice in writing in this behalf, allow the assessee an opportunity to credit within
the time specified in the notice or within such further time as the Assessing Officer may allow, a further
amount to the Investment Allowance Reserve Account out of the profits and gains of the previous year in
131 of 801

which such notice is served on the assessee or of the immediately preceding previous year, if the accounts
for that year have not been made up; and, if the assessee credits any further amount to such account within
the time aforesaid, the amount so credited shall be deemed to have been credited to the Investment
Allowance Reserve Account of the previous year in which the deduction is admissible and such amount
shall not be taken into account in determining the adequacy of the reserve required to be created by the
assessee in respect of the previous year in which such further credit is made:
Provided that such opportunity shall not be allowed by the Assessing Officer in a case where the difference
in the total income as proposed to be computed by him and the total income as returned by the assessee
arises out of the application of the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 145 or sub-section (2) of that section
or the omission by the assessee to disclose his income fully and truly.
(5) Any allowance made under this section in respect of any ship, aircraft, machinery or plant shall be
deemed to have been wrongly made for the purposes of this Act—

any time before the expiry of eight years from the end of the previous year in which it was acquired or
installed; or

aircraft was acquired or the machinery or plant was installed, the assessee does not utilise the amount
credited to the reserve account under sub-section (4) for the purposes of acquiring a new ship or a new
aircraft or new machinery or plant [other than machinery or plant of the nature referred to in clauses
(a), (b) and (d) of the second proviso to sub-section (1)] for the purposes of the business of the
undertaking; or
 (c) if at any time before the expiry of the ten years aforesaid, the assessee utilises the amount credited to
the reserve account under sub-section (4) for distribution by way of dividends or profits or for
remittance outside India as profits or for the creation of any assets outside India or for any other
purpose which is not a purpose of the business of the undertaking,
and the provisions of sub-section (4A) of section 155 shall apply accordingly:
Provided that nothing in clause (a) shall apply—
  (i) where the ship, aircraft, machinery or plant is sold or otherwise transferred by the assessee to the
Government, a local authority, a corporation established by a Central, State or Provincial Act or a
Government company as defined in section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956); or
 (ii) where the sale or transfer of the ship, aircraft, machinery or plant is made in connection with the
amalgamation or succession, referred to in sub-section (6) or sub-section (7).
(6) Where, in a scheme of amalgamation, the amalgamating company sells or otherwise transfers to the
amalgamated company any ship, aircraft, machinery or plant, in respect of which investment allowance has
been allowed to the amalgamating company under sub-section (1),—
  (a) the amalgamated company shall continue to fulfil the conditions mentioned in sub-section (4) in
respect of the reserve created by the amalgamating company and in respect of the period within which
such ship, aircraft, machinery or plant shall not be sold or otherwise transferred and in default of any
of these conditions, the provisions of sub-section (4A) of section 155 shall apply to the amalgamated
company as they would have applied to the amalgamating company had it committed the default; and
 (b) the balance of investment allowance, if any, still outstanding to the amalgamating company in respect
of such ship, aircraft, machinery or plant, shall be allowed to the amalgamated company in accordance
with the provisions of sub-section (3), so, however, that the total period for which the balance of
investment allowance shall be carried forward in the assessments of the amalgamating company and
the amalgamated company shall not exceed the period of eight years specified in sub-section (3) and
the amalgamated company shall be treated as the assessee in respect of such ship, aircraft, machinery
or plant for the purposes of this section.
(7) Where a firm is succeeded to by a company in the business carried on by it as a result of which the firm
sells or otherwise transfers to the company any ship, aircraft, machinery or plant, the provisions of clauses
(a) and (b) of sub-section (6) shall, so far as may be, apply to the firm and the company.

Provided that where the rights commenced, that is to say, became effective, in any year prior to the
previous year in which expenditure on the acquisition thereof was incurred by the assessee, this clause
shall have effect with the substitution for the reference to fourteen years of a reference to fourteen
years less the number of complete years which, when the rights are acquired by the assessee, have
elapsed since the commencement thereof, and if fourteen years have elapsed as aforesaid, of a
reference to one year;
155 of 801

(ii)  &quot;appropriate fraction&quot; means the fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which
is the number of the relevant previous years.
(2) Where the rights come to an end without being subsequently revived or where the whole or any part of

allowed under sub-section (1) shall be arrived at by—
(a)  subtracting the proceeds of the sale (so far as they consist of capital sums) from the amount of the cost
of acquisition of the rights remaining unallowed; and
(b)   dividing the remainder by the number of relevant previous years which have not expired at the

(5) Where the assessee is a person other than a company or a co-operative society, the deduction under sub-
section (1) shall not be admissible unless the accounts of the industrial undertaking or the business of the

carrying on the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel to which this section applies and any other
person, or for any other reason, the course of business between them is so arranged that the business
transacted between them produces to the assessee more than the ordinary profits which might be expected to
arise in the business of the industrial undertaking or the hotel, the Assessing Officer shall, in computing the
profits and gains of the industrial undertaking or the hotel for the purposes of the deduction under this
section, take the amount of profits as may be reasonably deemed to have been derived therefrom.

Impermissible avoidance arrangement.
96. (1) An impermissible avoidance arrangement means an arrangement, the main purpose of which is to
obtain a tax benefit, and it—

386 of 801

(b) results, directly or indirectly, in the misuse, or abuse, of the provisions of this Act;
(c) lacks commercial substance or is deemed to lack commercial substance under section 97, in whole or
in part; or
(d) is entered into, or carried out, by means, or in a manner, which are not ordinarily employed for bona
fide purposes.
(2) An arrangement shall be presumed, unless it is proved to the contrary by the assessee, to have been
entered into, or carried out, for the main purpose of obtaining a tax benefit, if the main purpose of a step in,
or a part of, the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit, notwithstanding the fact that the main purpose of the
whole arrangement is not to obtain a tax benefit.
</text></item><item type="dict"><id type="int">294</id><title type="str">Section 97 - Arrangement to lack commercial substance</title><text type="str">Arrangement to lack commercial substance.
97. (1) An arrangement shall be deemed to lack commercial substance, if—
(a) the substance or effect of the arrangement as a whole, is inconsistent with, or differs significantly from,
the form of its individual steps or a part; or
(b) it involves or includes—
 (i) round trip financing;
(ii) an accommodating party;
(iii) elements that have effect of offsetting or cancelling each other; or
(iv) a transaction which is conducted through one or more persons and disguises the value, location,
source, ownership or control of funds which is the subject matter of such transaction; or
(c) it involves the location of an asset or of a transaction or of the place of residence of any party which is
without any substantial commercial purpose other than obtaining a tax benefit (but for the provisions
of this Chapter) for a party; or
(d) it does not have a significant effect upon the business risks or net cash flows of any party to the
arrangement apart from any effect attributable to the tax benefit that would be obtained (but for the
provisions of this Chapter).
(2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), round trip financing includes any arrangement in which, through a
series of transactions—
(a) funds are transferred among the parties to the arrangement; and
(b) such transactions do not have any substantial commercial purpose other than obtaining the tax benefit
(but for the provisions of this Chapter),
without having any regard to—
(A) whether or not the funds involved in the round trip financing can be traced to any funds transferred to,
or received by, any party in connection with the arrangement;
(B) the time, or sequence, in which the funds involved in the round trip financing are transferred or
received; or
(C) the means by, or manner in, or mode through, which funds involved in the round trip financing are
transferred or received.
(3) For the purposes of this Chapter, a party to an arrangement shall be an accommodating party, if the main
purpose of the direct or indirect participation of that party in the arrangement, in whole or in part, is to
obtain, directly or indirectly, a tax benefit (but for the provisions of this Chapter) for the assessee whether or
not the party is a connected person in relation to any party to the arrangement.
(4) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the following may be relevant but shall not be
sufficient for determining whether an arrangement lacks commercial substance or not, namely:—
  (i) the period or time for which the arrangement (including operations therein) exists;
 (ii) the fact of payment of taxes, directly or indirectly, under the arrangement;
(iii) the fact that an exit route (including transfer of any activity or business or operations) is provided by
the arrangement.

shipping income for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be taxable under the other provisions of this Act.
(2) The core activities of a tonnage tax company shall be—

either case, the consideration, if any, for such transfer as recorded in the accounts of the tonnage tax
business does not correspond to the market value of such goods or services as on the date of the transfer,
then, the relevant shipping income under this section shall be computed as if the transfer, in either case, had
been made at the market value of such goods or services as on that date:
Provided that where, in the opinion of the Assessing Officer, the computation of the relevant shipping
income in the manner hereinbefore specified presents exceptional difficulties, the Assessing Officer may

(8) Where it appears to the Assessing Officer that, owing to the close connection between the tonnage tax
company and any other person, or for any other reason, the course of business between them is so arranged
that the business transacted between them produces to the tonnage tax company more than the ordinary
profits which might be expected to arise in the tonnage tax business, the Assessing Officer shall, in
computing the relevant shipping income of the tonnage tax company for the purposes of this Chapter, take
the amount of income as may reasonably be deemed to have been derived therefrom.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this Chapter, in case the relevant shipping income of a tonnage tax
company is a loss, then, such loss shall be ignored for the purposes of computing tonnage income.

115VK. (1) For the purposes of computing depreciation under clause (iv) of section 115VL, the depreciation
for the first previous year of the tonnage tax scheme (hereafter in this section referred to as the first previous
year) shall be computed on the written down value of the qualifying ships as specified under sub-section (2).
(2) The written down value of the block of assets, being ships, as on the first day of the first previous year,
shall be divided in the ratio of the book written down value of the qualifying ships (hereafter in this section
referred to as the qualifying assets) and the book written down value of the non-qualifying ships (hereafter
in this section referred to as the other assets).
(3) The block of qualifying assets as determined under sub-section (2) shall constitute a separate block of
assets for the purposes of this Chapter.
(4) For the purposes of sub-section (2), the book written down value of the block of qualifying assets and
the block of other assets shall be computed in the following manner, namely:—
 (a) the book written down value of each qualifying asset and each other asset as on the first day of the
previous year and which form part of the block of assets to be divided shall be determined by taking
the book written down value of each asset appearing in the books of account as on the last day of the
preceding previous year:
Provided that any change in the value of the assets consequent to their revaluation after the date on
which the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004 receives the assent of the President shall be ignored;

 (c) the ratio of the aggregate book written down value of the qualifying assets to the aggregate book
written down value of the other assets shall be determined.
(5) Where an asset forming part of a block of qualifying assets begins to be used for purposes other than the
tonnage tax business, an appropriate portion of the written down value allocable to such asset shall be
reduced from the written down value of that block and shall be added to the block of other assets.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, appropriate portion of the written down value allocable
to the asset, which begins to be used for purposes other than the tonnage tax business, shall be an amount
which bears the same proportion to the written down value of the block of qualifying assets as on the first
day of the previous year as the book written down value of the asset beginning to be used for purposes other
452 of 801

than tonnage tax business bears to the book written down value of all the assets forming the block of
qualifying asset.
(6) Where an asset forming part of a block of other assets begins to be used for tonnage tax business, an
appropriate portion of the written down value allocable to such asset shall be reduced from the written down
value of the block of other assets and shall be added to the block of qualifying asset.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, appropriate portion of written down value allocable to
the asset which begins to be used for the tonnage tax business shall be an amount which bears the same
proportion to the written down value of the block of other assets as on the first day of the previous year as
the book written down value of the asset beginning to be used for tonnage tax business bears to the total
book written down value of all the assets forming the block of other assets.
(7) For the purposes of computing depreciation under clause (iv) of section 115VL in respect of an asset
mentioned in sub-sections (5) and (6), depreciation computed for the previous year shall be allocated in the
ratio of the number of days for which the asset was used for the tonnage tax business and for purposes other

require on specified points, and after taking into account all relevant material which he has gathered, the
Assessing Officer shall, by an order in writing, make an assessment of the value of the fringe benefits paid
or payable by the assessee, and determine the sum payable by him or refund of any amount due to him on
the basis of such assessment.

benefits to the best of his judgment and determine the sum payable by the assessee on the basis of such
assessment:
Provided that such opportunity shall be given by the Assessing Officer by serving a notice calling upon the
assessee to show cause, on a date and time to be specified in the notice as to why the assessment should not
be completed to the best of his judgment:
Provided further that it shall not be necessary to give such opportunity in a case where a notice under sub-

470 of 801

failed to comply with any requirement specified in such provision for claiming deduction thereunder,
subject to the following conditions, namely:—
   (i) the default in complying with such requirement was due to circumstances beyond the control
of the assessee; and

Jurisdiction of income-tax authorities.
120. (1) Income-tax authorities shall exercise all or any of the powers and perform all or any of the
functions conferred on, or, as the case may be, assigned to such authorities by or under this Act in
accordance with such directions as the Board may issue for the exercise of the powers and performance of
the functions by all or any of those authorities.
Explanation.—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that any income-tax authority, being an
authority higher in rank, may, if so directed by the Board, exercise the powers and perform the functions of
the income-tax authority lower in rank and any such direction issued by the Board shall be deemed to be a
direction issued under sub-section (1).
(2) The directions of the Board under sub-section (1) may authorise any other income-tax authority to issue
orders in writing for the exercise of the powers and performance of the functions by all or any of the other
income-tax authorities who are subordinate to it.
(3) In issuing the directions or orders referred to in sub-sections (1) and (2), the Board or other income-tax
authority authorised by it may have regard to any one or more of the following criteria, namely :—
 (a) territorial area;
 (b) persons or classes of persons;
 (c) incomes or classes of income; and

471 of 801

under this Act in respect of any specified area or persons or classes of persons or incomes or classes of
income or cases or classes of cases, shall be exercised or performed by an Additional Commissioner or
an Additional Director or a Joint Commissioner or a Joint Director, and, where any order is made
under this clause, references in any other provision of this Act, or in any rule made thereunder to the
Assessing Officer shall be deemed to be references to such Additional Commissioner or Additional
Director or Joint Commissioner or Joint Director by whom the powers and functions are to be
exercised or performed under such order, and any provision of this Act requiring approval or sanction
of the Joint Commissioner shall not apply.
(5) The directions and orders referred to in sub-sections (1) and (2) may, wherever considered necessary or
appropriate for the proper management of the work, require two or more Assessing Officers (whether or not
of the same class) to exercise and perform, concurrently, the powers and functions in respect of any area or
persons or classes of persons or incomes or classes of income or cases or classes of cases; and, where such
powers and functions are exercised and performed concurrently by the Assessing Officers of different
classes, any authority lower in rank amongst them shall exercise the powers and perform the functions as
any higher authority amongst them may direct, and, further, references in any other provision of this Act or
in any rule made thereunder to the Assessing Officer shall be deemed to be references to such higher
authority and any provision of this Act requiring approval or sanction of any such authority shall not apply.

the Board may, by notification in the Official Gazette, direct that for the purpose of furnishing of the return
of income or the doing of any other act or thing under this Act or any rule made thereunder by any person or
class of persons, the income-tax authority exercising and performing the powers and functions in relation to
the said person or class of persons shall be such authority as may be specified in the notification.

doing so, transfer any case from one or more Assessing Officers subordinate to him (whether with or

same Principal Director General or Director General or Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief
Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner,—

jurisdiction and is succeeded by another who has and exercises jurisdiction, the income-tax authority so
succeeding may continue the proceeding from the stage at which the proceeding was left by his predecessor:

 (c) exercise of power to transfer cases under section 127; or

the powers under this sub-section in all cases where he has reason to believe that any delay in getting the

Provided further that where it is not possible or practicable to take physical possession of any valuable
article or thing and remove it to a safe place due to its volume, weight or other physical characteristics or
due to its being of a dangerous nature, the authorised officer may serve an order on the owner or the person
who is in immediate possession or control thereof that he shall not remove, part with or otherwise deal with
it, except with the previous permission of such authorised officer and such action of the authorised officer
shall be deemed to be seizure of such valuable article or thing under clause (iii):

of section 154 shall, so far as may be, apply thereto:
Provided that the credit of tax which was under dispute shall be allowed for the year in which such income
is offered to tax or assessed to tax in India.
(15) Where in the assessment for any year, a capital gain arising from the transfer of a capital asset, being
land or building or both, is computed by taking the full value of the consideration received or accruing as a
result of the transfer to be the value adopted or assessed by any authority of a State Government for the
purpose of payment of stamp duty in accordance with sub-section (1) of section 50C, and subsequently such
value is revised in any appeal or revision or reference referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (2) of that
section, the Assessing Officer shall amend the order of assessment so as to compute the capital gain by
taking the full value of the consideration to be the value as so revised in such appeal or revision or
reference; and the provisions of section 154 shall, so far as may be, apply thereto, and the period of four
545 of 801

years shall be reckoned from the end of the previous year in which the order revising the value was passed
in that appeal or revision or reference.
(16) Where in the assessment for any year, a capital gain arising from the transfer of a capital asset, being a
transfer by way of compulsory acquisition under any law, or a transfer, the consideration for which was
determined or approved by the Central Government or the Reserve Bank of India, is computed by taking the
compensation or consideration as referred to in clause (a) or, as the case may be, the compensation or
consideration enhanced or further enhanced as referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (5) of section 45, to be
the full value of consideration deemed to be received or accruing as a result of the transfer of the asset and
subsequently such compensation or consideration is reduced by any court, Tribunal or other authority, the
Assessing Officer shall amend the order of assessment so as to compute the capital gain by taking the
compensation or consideration as so reduced by the court, Tribunal or any other authority to be the full
value of consideration; and the provisions of section 154 shall, so far as may be, apply thereto, and the
period of four years shall be reckoned from the end of the previous year in which the order reducing the

in clause (i) of sub-section (1) of section 2, of the Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970), as the case may be, was
passed.
75[(18) Where any deduction in respect of any surcharge or cess, which is not allowable as deduction under
section 40, has been claimed and allowed in the case of an assessee in any previous year, such claim shall be
deemed to be under-reported income of the assessee for such previous year for the purposes of sub-section
(3) of section 270A, notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (6) of section 270A, and the
Assessing Officer shall recompute the total income of the assessee for such previous year and make
necessary amendment; and the provisions of section 154 shall, so far as may be, apply thereto, the period of
four years specified in sub-section (7) of section 154 being reckoned from the end of the previous year

form76 and within the prescribed time, requesting for recomputation of the total income of the previous year
without allowing the claim for deduction of surcharge or cess and pays the amount due thereon within the
specified time, such claim shall not be deemed to be under-reported income for the purposes of sub-section
(3) of section 270A.]
77[(19) Where any deduction in respect of any expenditure incurred for the purchase of sugarcane has been
claimed by an assessee, being a co-operative society engaged in the business of manufacture of sugar, and
such deduction has been disallowed wholly or partly in any previous year commencing on or before the 1st
day of April, 2014, the Assessing Officer shall, on the basis of an application made by such assessee in this
regard, recompute the total income of the assessee for such previous year after allowing deduction to the
extent such expenditure is incurred at a price which is equal to or less than the price fixed or approved by
the Government for that previous year, and the provisions of section 154 shall, so far as may be, apply
thereto, and the period of four years specified in sub-section (7) of that section shall be reckoned from the

of Chapter XVII-B in a subsequent financial year, the Assessing Officer shall, on an application made by the
assessee in such form, as may be prescribed, within a period of two years from the end of the financial year
in which such tax was deducted at source, amend the order of assessment or any intimation allowing credit
of such tax deducted at source in the relevant assessment year, and the provisions of section 154 shall, so far
as may be, apply thereto and the period of four years specified in sub-section (7) of that section shall be
reckoned from the end of the financial year in which such tax has been deducted:
Provided that the credit of such tax deducted at source shall not be allowed in any other assessment year.]

(a) where the calculation is made by the assessee for the purposes of payment of advance tax under sub-
section (1) or sub-section (2) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) of section 210, he shall first estimate
his current income and income-tax thereon shall be calculated at the rates in force in the financial

(b) where the calculation is made by the Assessing Officer for the purpose of making an order under sub-
section (3) of section 210, the total income of the latest previous year in respect of which the assessee
has been assessed by way of regular assessment or the total income returned by the assessee in any

taken and income-tax thereon shall be calculated at the rates in force in the financial year;

year under any provision of this Act from any income (as computed before allowing any deductions
admissible under this Act) which has been taken into account in computing the current income or, as
the case may be, the total income aforesaid; and the amount of income-tax as so reduced shall be the

Provided that for computing liability for advance tax, income-tax calculated under clause (a) or clause (b)
or clause (c) shall not, in each case, be reduced by the aforesaid amount of income-tax which would be

agricultural income (as defined in that Act) shall be taken into account for the purposes of computing
advance tax, then, the net agricultural income to be taken into account in the case of any assessee falling in
that class, shall be—

the net agricultural income which has been taken into account for the purposes of charging
income-tax for the assessment year relevant to that previous year; or
(ii) if the total income declared by the assessee for the later previous year referred to in sub-section

returned by the assessee in the return of income for the assessment year relevant to such later
previous year;

in the case of any such Hindu undivided family, compute (subject to the provisions of section 164) the
advance tax at such rate or rates—
(a) in a case where the total income of the latest previous year in respect of which the Hindu undivided
family has been assessed by way of regular assessment forms the basis of computation of advance tax,
if the total income of any member of the family for the assessment year relevant to such latest
previous year exceeds the maximum amount not chargeable to income-tax in his case;
(b) in a case where the total income of the previous year in respect of which a return of income is
furnished by the Hindu undivided family under section 139 or in response to a notice under sub-

Provided also that where any application is pending as on the 1st day of June, 2016, the order shall be
passed on or before the 31st day of May, 2017.
(2B) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where interest is charged under sub-section
(1A) of section 201 on the amount of tax specified in the intimation issued under sub-section (1) of section
628 of 801

200A for any period, then, no interest shall be charged under sub-section (2) on the same amount for the

circumstances of the case.
(4) If the amount is not paid within the time limited under sub-section (1) or extended under sub-section (3),
as the case may be, at the place and to the person mentioned in the said notice the assessee shall be deemed
to be in default.
(5) If, in a case where payment by instalments is allowed under sub-section (3), the assessee commits
defaults in paying any one of the instalments within the time fixed under that sub-section, the assessee shall
be deemed to be in default as to the whole of the amount then outstanding, and the other instalment or
instalments shall be deemed to have been due on the same date as the instalment actually in default.
(6) Where an assessee has presented an appeal under section 246 or section 246A the Assessing Officer may,
in his discretion and subject to such conditions as he may think fit to impose in the circumstances of the
case, treat the assessee as not being in default in respect of the amount in dispute in the appeal, even though
the time for payment has expired, as long as such appeal remains undisposed of.
(7) Where an assessee has been assessed in respect of income arising outside India in a country the laws of
which prohibit or restrict the remittance of money to India, the Assessing Officer shall not treat the assessee
as in default in respect of that part of the tax which is due in respect of that amount of his income which, by
reason of such prohibition or restriction, cannot be brought into India, and shall continue to treat the
assessee as not in default in respect of such part of the tax until the prohibition or restriction is removed.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, income shall be deemed to have been brought into India if it
has been utilised or could have been utilised for the purposes of any expenditure actually incurred by the
assessee outside India or if the income, whether capitalised or not, has been brought into India in any form.

221. (1) When an assessee is in default or is deemed to be in default in making a payment of tax, he shall, in
addition to the amount of the arrears and the amount of interest payable under sub-section (2) of section
220, be liable, by way of penalty, to pay such amount as the Assessing Officer may direct, and in the case of
a continuing default, such further amount or amounts as the Assessing Officer may, from time to time,
direct, so, however, that the total amount of penalty does not exceed the amount of tax in arrears:
Provided that before levying any such penalty, the assessee shall be given a reasonable opportunity of being
heard:
Provided further that where the assessee proves to the satisfaction of the Assessing Officer that the default
was for good and sufficient reasons, no penalty shall be levied under this section.
Explanation.—For the removal of doubt, it is hereby declared that an assessee shall not cease to be liable to
any penalty under this sub-section merely by reason of the fact that before the levy of such penalty he has
paid the tax.
(2) Where as a result of any final order the amount of tax, with respect to the default in the payment of
which the penalty was levied, has been wholly reduced, the penalty levied shall be cancelled and the amount

Chapter referred to as the transferor) to another person (hereafter in this Chapter referred to as the

value, it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the consideration for such transfer as

269F. (1) The competent authority shall fix a day and place for the hearing of the objections made under
section 269E against the acquisition under this Chapter of any immovable property, and shall give notice of

(a)   the immovable property to which the proceedings relate is of a fair market value exceeding one
hundred thousand rupees ;

property is of the nature referred to in sub-clause (ii) of clause (e) of section 269A on the date of the transfer,

(a) in a case where the order for acquisition is not made the subject of an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal

Provided that in a case where, under the agreement between the parties concerned, the whole or any part of

the aggregate of the following amounts, namely :—
(i)   an amount equal to fifteen per cent of the apparent consideration ;
(ii)  the amount, if any, that has become payable in accordance with such agreement on or before the date
on which such property is acquired under this Chapter ; and

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1),—
(a)  where, after the transfer to the transferee of the property referred to in that sub-section but before the
vesting of the property in the Central Government, the property has been damaged (otherwise than as
a result of normal wear and tear), the compensation payable under that sub-section shall be reduced by
such amount as the competent authority and the persons entitled to the compensation may agree within

duly authorised for the purpose by the competent authority, determine to be the amount that may have

realised by the Central Government as a penalty from the transferee for being a party to a transfer with such
object as is referred to in clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 269C, and no penalty shall be
levied for any assessment year on the transferee—

inaccurate particulars of so much of his income as is utilised by him for paying to the transferor, by

amount in the computation of his income and has disclosed all the facts material to the addition or
disallowance;

section 115WE or under sub-section (1) of section 142 or sub-section (2) of section 143 or fails to

benefits,
he may direct that such person shall pay by way of penalty,—
(i)   [***]
(ii)  in the cases referred to in clause (b), in addition to tax, if any, payable by him, a sum of ten thousand
rupees for each such failure ;
(iii) in the cases referred to in clause (c) or clause (d), in addition to tax, if any, payable by him, a sum
which shall not be less than, but which shall not exceed three times, the amount of tax sought to be
evaded by reason of the concealment of particulars of his income or fringe benefits or the furnishing
of inaccurate particulars of such income or fringe benefits.
Explanation 1.—Where in respect of any facts material to the computation of the total income of any person
under this Act,—
(A) such person fails to offer an explanation or offers an explanation which is found by the Assessing
Officer or the35[Joint Commissioner (Appeals) or the] Commissioner (Appeals) or the Principal
Commissioner or Commissioner to be false, or
(B) such person offers an explanation which he is not able to substantiate and fails to prove that such
explanation is bona fide and that all the facts relating to the same and material to the computation of
his total income have been disclosed by him,
then, the amount added or disallowed in computing the total income of such person as a result thereof shall,
for the purposes of clause (c) of this sub-section, be deemed to represent the income in respect of which
particulars have been concealed.
Explanation 2.—Where the source of any receipt, deposit, outgoing or investment in any assessment year is
claimed by any person to be an amount which had been added in computing the income or deducted in
computing the loss in the assessment of such person for any earlier assessment year or years but in respect
of which no penalty under clause (iii) of this sub-section had been levied, that part of the amount so added
or deducted in such earlier assessment year immediately preceding the year in which the receipt, deposit,
outgoing or investment appears (such earlier assessment year hereafter in this Explanation referred to as the
first preceding year) which is sufficient to cover the amount represented by such receipt, deposit or outgoing
or value of such investment (such amount or value hereafter in this Explanation referred to as the utilised
amount) shall be treated as the income of the assessee, particulars of which had been concealed or
inaccurate particulars of which had been furnished for the first preceding year; and where the amount so
added or deducted in the first preceding year is not sufficient to cover the utilised amount, that part of the
amount so added or deducted in the year immediately preceding the first preceding year which is sufficient
to cover such part of the utilised amount as is not so covered shall be treated to be the income of the
assessee, particulars of which had been concealed or inaccurate particulars of which had been furnished for
the year immediately preceding the first preceding year and so on, until the entire utilised amount is covered
by the amounts so added or deducted in such earlier assessment years.
Explanation 3.—Where any person fails, without reasonable cause, to furnish within the period specified in
sub-section (1) of section 153 a return of his income which he is required to furnish under section 139 in
respect of any assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April, 1989, and until the expiry of the
715 of 801

period aforesaid, no notice has been issued to him under clause (i) of sub-section (1) of section 142 or
section 148 and the Assessing Officer or the36[Joint Commissioner (Appeals) or the] Commissioner
(Appeals) is satisfied that in respect of such assessment year such person has taxable income, then, such
person shall, for the purposes of clause (c) of this sub-section, be deemed to have concealed the particulars
of his income in respect of such assessment year, notwithstanding that such person furnishes a return of his
income at any time after the expiry of the period aforesaid in pursuance of a notice under section 148.
Explanation 4.—For the purposes of clause (iii) of this sub-section,—
(a)  the amount of tax sought to be evaded shall be determined in accordance with the following formula
—
(A – B) + (C – D)
where,
A = amount of tax on the total income assessed as per the provisions other than the provisions
contained in section 115JB or section 115JC (herein called general provisions);
B = amount of tax that would have been chargeable had the total income assessed as per the general
provisions been reduced by the amount of income in respect of which particulars have been concealed
or inaccurate particulars have been furnished;
C = amount of tax on the total income assessed as per the provisions contained in section 115JB or
section 115JC;
D = amount of tax that would have been chargeable had the total income assessed as per the
provisions contained in section 115JB or section 115JC been reduced by the amount of income in
respect of which particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished:
Provided that where the amount of income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or
inaccurate particulars have been furnished on any issue is considered both under the provisions
contained in section 115JB or section 115JC and under general provisions, such amount shall not be
reduced from total income assessed while determining the amount under item D :
Provided further that in a case where the provisions contained in section 115JB or section 115JC are
not applicable, the item (C – D) in the formula shall be ignored;
(b)   where in any case the amount of income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or
inaccurate particulars have been furnished has the effect of reducing the loss declared in the return or
converting that loss into income, the amount of tax sought to be evaded shall be determined in
accordance with the formula specified in clause (a) with the modification that the amount to be
determined for item (A – B) in that formula shall be the amount of tax that would have been
chargeable on the income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars
have been furnished had such income been the total income;
(c)  where in any case to which Explanation 3 applies, the amount of tax sought to be evaded shall be the
tax on the total income assessed as reduced by the amount of advance tax, tax deducted at source, tax
collected at source and self-assessment tax paid before the issue of notice under section 148.
Explanation 5.—Where in the course of a search initiated under section 132 before the 1st day of June,
2007, the assessee is found to be the owner of any money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or
thing (hereafter in this Explanation referred to as assets) and the assessee claims that such assets have been
acquired by him by utilising (wholly or in part) his income,—
(a)  for any previous year which has ended before the date of the search, but the return of income for such
year has not been furnished before the said date or, where such return has been furnished before the
said date, such income has not been declared therein ; or
(b)  for any previous year which is to end on or after the date of the search,
then, notwithstanding that such income is declared by him in any return of income furnished on or after the
date of the search, he shall, for the purposes of imposition of a penalty under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of
this section, be deemed to have concealed the particulars of his income or furnished inaccurate particulars of
such income, unless,—
(1) such income is, or the transactions resulting in such income are recorded,—
 (i)   in a case falling under clause (a), before the date of the search; and
716 of 801

(ii)   in a case falling under clause (b), on or before such date,
in the books of account, if any, maintained by him for any source of income or such income is
otherwise disclosed to the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal

(2) he, in the course of the search, makes a statement under sub-section (4) of section 132 that any money,
bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or thing found in his possession or under his control, has
been acquired out of his income which has not been disclosed so far in his return of income to be
furnished before the expiry of time specified in sub-section (1) of section 139, and also specifies in the
statement the manner in which such income has been derived and pays the tax, together with interest,
if any, in respect of such income.
Explanation 5A.— Where, in the course of a search initiated under section 132 on or after the 1st day of

to as assets) and the assessee claims that such assets have been acquired by him by utilising (wholly or
in part) his income for any previous year; or
(ii) any income based on any entry in any books of account or other documents or transactions and he
claims that such entry in the books of account or other documents or transactions represents his
income (wholly or in part) for any previous year,
which has ended before the date of search and,—
(a)  where the return of income for such previous year has been furnished before the said date but such
income has not been declared therein; or
(b)  the due date for filing the return of income for such previous year has expired but the assessee has not
filed the return,
then, notwithstanding that such income is declared by him in any return of income furnished on or after the
date of search, he shall, for the purposes of imposition of a penalty under clause (c) of sub-section (1) of this
section, be deemed to have concealed the particulars of his income or furnished inaccurate particulars of
such income.
Explanation 6.—Where any adjustment is made in the income or loss declared in the return under the
proviso to clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 143 and additional tax charged under that section, the
provisions of this sub-section shall not apply in relation to the adjustment so made.
Explanation 7.—Where in the case of an assessee who has entered into an international transaction or
specified domestic transaction defined in section 92B, any amount is added or disallowed in computing the
total income under sub-section (4) of section 92C, then, the amount so added or disallowed shall, for the
purposes of clause (c) of this sub-section, be deemed to represent the income in respect of which particulars
have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished, unless the assessee proves to the
satisfaction of the Assessing Officer or37[the Joint Commissioner (Appeals) or] the Commissioner
(Appeals) or the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner that the price charged or paid in such transaction
was computed in accordance with the provisions contained in section 92C and in the manner prescribed
under that section, in good faith and with due diligence.
(1A) Where any penalty is imposable by virtue of Explanation 2 to sub- section (1), proceedings for the
imposition of such penalty may be initiated notwithstanding that any proceedings under this Act in the
course of which such penalty proceedings could have been initiated under sub-section (1) have been
completed.
(1B) Where any amount is added or disallowed in computing the total income or loss of an assessee in any
order of assessment or reassessment and the said order contains a direction for initiation of penalty
proceedings under clause (c) of sub-section (1), such an order of assessment or reassessment shall be
deemed to constitute satisfaction of the Assessing Officer for initiation of the penalty proceedings under the
said clause (c).
(2) When the person liable to penalty is a registered firm or an unregistered firm which has been assessed
under clause (b) of section 183, then, notwithstanding anything contained in the other provisions of this Act,
the penalty imposable under sub-section (1) shall be the same amount as would be imposable on that firm if

partnership on the basis of which the firm has been registered under this Act, and that any partner has
thereby returned his income below its real amount, he may direct that such partner shall, in addition to the
tax, if any, payable by him, pay by way of penalty a sum not exceeding one and a half times the amount of

accepted as his correct income; and no refund or other adjustment shall be claimable by any other partner by
reason of such direction.

aforesaid was inserted in the certificate fraudulently or without the consent of the real purchaser, or interfere

(a)  they shall first be adjusted towards the amount due under the certificate in execution of which the
assets were realised and the costs incurred in the course of such execution;

satisfaction of any other amount recoverable from the assessee under this Act which may be due on
the date on which the assets were realised; and
(c)  the balance, if any, remaining after the adjustments under clauses (a) and (b) shall be paid to the

fraud.
Property exempt from attachment.

Provided that no such investigation shall be made where the Tax Recovery Officer considers that the claim
or objection was designedly or unnecessarily delayed.

Recovery Officer ordering the sale may postpone it pending the investigation of the claim or objection, upon
such terms as to security or otherwise as the Tax Recovery Officer shall deem fit.
(3) The claimant or objector must adduce evidence to show that—
(a)  (in the case of immovable property) at the date of the service of the notice issued under this Schedule
to pay the arrears, or
(b)  (in the case of movable property) at the date of the attachment,
he had some interest in, or was possessed of, the property in question.

person in trust for him or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him, or that, being in
the possession of the defaulter at the said date, it was so in his possession, not on his own account or as his
own property, but on account of or in trust for some other person, or partly on his own account and partly on
account of some other person, the Tax Recovery Officer shall make an order releasing the property, wholly
or to such extent as he thinks fit, from attachment or sale.
(5) Where the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that the property was, at the said date, in the possession of
the defaulter as his own property and not on account of any other person, or was in the possession of some
other person in trust for him, or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him, the Tax
Recovery Officer shall disallow the claim.
(6) Where a claim or an objection is preferred, the party against whom an order is made may institute a suit
in a civil court to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute; but, subject to the result of
such suit (if any), the order of the Tax Recovery Officer shall be conclusive.

mortgage or lease or private sale of such property, or some part thereof, or of any other immovable property
of the defaulter, the Tax Recovery Officer may, on his application, postpone the sale of the property
comprised in the order for sale, on such terms, and for such period as he thinks proper, to enable him to raise
the amount.

sale is set aside under rule 61, the aforesaid period of limitation for the sale of the immovable property shall
stand extended by one year.
(2) In computing the period of limitation under sub-rule (1), the period—
 (i)  during which the levy of the aforesaid tax, interest, fine, penalty or any other sum is stayed by an
order or injunction of any court; or

the employee&apos;s ill-health, or by the contraction or discontinuance of the employer&apos;s business or other
cause beyond the control of the employee, or
(iii) if, on the cessation of his employment, the employee obtains employment with any other employer, to
the extent the accumulated balance due and becoming payable to him is transferred to his individual
account in any recognised provident fund maintained by such other employer; or
(iv) if the entire balance standing to the credit of the employee is transferred to his account under a pension
scheme referred to in section 80CCD and notified by the Central Government.
Explanation.—Where the accumulated balance due and becoming payable to an employee participating in a
recognised provident fund maintained by his employer includes any amount transferred from his individual
account in any other recognised provident fund or funds maintained by his former employer or employers,
then, in computing the period of continuous service for the purposes of clause (i) or clause (ii) the period or
periods for which such employee rendered continuous service under his former employer or employers
aforesaid shall be included.
Tax on accumulated balance.
9. (1) Where the accumulated balance due to an employee participating in a recognised provident fund is
included in his total income owing to the provi-sions of rule 8 not being applicable, the Assessing Officer
shall calculate the total of the various sums of tax which would have been payable by the employee in
respect of his total income for each of the years concerned if the fund had not been a recognised provident
fund, and the amount by which such total exceeds the total of all sums paid by or on behalf of such
employee by way of tax for such years shall be payable by the employee in addition to any other tax for
which he may be liable for the previous year in which the accumulated balance due to him becomes
payable.
(2) Where the accumulated balance due to an employee participating in a recognised provident fund which
is not included in his total income under the provisions of rule 8 becomes payable, an amount equal to the
aggregate of the amounts of super-tax on annual accretions that would have been payable under section 58E
of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (11 of 1922), for any assessment year up to and including the assessment
year 1932-33, if the Indian Income-tax (Second Amendment) Act, 1933 (18 of 1933), had come into force
on the 15th day of March, 1930, shall be payable by the employee in addition to any other tax payable by
him for the previous year in which such balance becomes payable.
Deduction at source of tax payable on accumulated balance.
785 of 801

10. The trustees of a recognised provident fund, or any person authorised by the regulations of the fund to
make payment of accumulated balances due to employees, shall, in cases where sub-rule (1) of rule 9
applies, at the time an accumulated balance due to an employee is paid, deduct therefrom the amount
payable under that rule and all the provisions of Chapter XVII-B shall apply as if the accumulated balance
were income chargeable under the head &quot;Salaries&quot;.
Treatment of balance in newly recognised provident fund.
11. (1) Where recognition is accorded to a provident fund with existing balances, an account shall be made
of the fund up to the day immediately preceding the day on which the recognition takes effect, showing the
balance to the credit of each employee on such day, and containing such further particulars as the Board
may prescribe.
(2) The account shall also show in respect of the balance to the credit of each employee the amount thereof
which is to be transferred to that employee&apos;s account in the recognised provident fund, and such amount
(hereinafter called his transferred balance) shall be shown as the balance to his credit in the recognised
provident fund on the date on which the recognition of the fund takes effect, and sub-rule (4) of this rule and
sub-rule (5) of rule 5 shall apply thereto.
(3) Any portion of the balance to the credit of an employee in the existing fund which is not transferred to
the recognised fund shall be excluded from the accounts of the recognised fund and shall be liable to
income-tax in accordance with the provisions of this Act, other than this Part.
(4) Subject to such rules as the Board may make in this behalf, the Assessing Officer shall make a
calculation of the aggregate of all sums comprised in a transferred balance which would have been liable to
income-tax if this Part had been in force from the date of the institution of the fund, without regard to any
tax which may have been paid on any sum, and such aggregate (if any) shall be deemed to be income
received by the employee in the previous year in which the recognition of the fund takes effect and shall be
included in the employee&apos;s total income for that previous year, and, for the purposes of assessment, the
remainder of the transferred balance shall be disregarded, but no other exemption or relief, by way of refund
or otherwise, shall be granted in respect of any sum comprised in such transferred balance :
Provided that, in cases of serious accounting difficulty, the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief
Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may, subject to the said rules, make a summary
calculation of such aggregate.
(5) Nothing in this rule shall affect the rights of the persons administering an unrecognised provident fund or
dealing with it, or with the balance to the credit of any individual employee before recognition is accorded,
in any manner which may be lawful.
Accounts of recognised provident funds.
12. (1) The accounts of a recognised provident fund shall be maintained by the trustees of the fund and shall
be in such form and for such periods, and shall contain such particulars, as the Board may prescribe.
(2) The accounts shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times by income-tax authorities, and the
trustees shall furnish to the Assessing Officer such abstracts thereof as the Board may prescribe.
Appeals.
13. (1) An employer objecting to an order of the Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or
Principal Commissioner or Commissioner refusing to recognise or an order withdrawing recognition from a
provident fund may appeal, within sixty days of such order, to the Board.
(2) The appeal shall be in such form and shall be verified in such manner and shall be subject to the payment
of such fee as the Board may prescribe.
Treatment of fund transferred by employer to trustee.
14. (1) Where an employer, who maintains a provident fund (whether recognised or not) for the benefit of
his employees and has not transferred the fund or any portion of it, transfers such fund or portion to trustees
in trust for the employees participating in the fund, the amount so transferred shall be deemed to be of the
nature of capital expenditure.
(2) When an employee participating in such fund is paid the accumulated balance due to him therefrom, any
portion of such balance as represents his share in the amount so transferred to the trustees (without addition
of interest, and exclusive of the employee&apos;s contributions and interest thereon) shall, if the employer has
786 of 801

made effective arrangements to secure that tax shall be deducted at source from the amount of such share
when paid to the employee, be deemed to be an expenditure by the employer within the meaning of section
37, incurred in the previous year in which the accumulated balance due to the employee is paid.
99Provisions relating to rules.
15. (1) In addition to any power conferred by this Part, the Board may make rules—
